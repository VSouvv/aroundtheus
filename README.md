# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### The Project overview:

This project is a responsive webpage where all elements are displayed correctly on various screen sizes using HTML/CSS with new techniques on positioning.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!!
